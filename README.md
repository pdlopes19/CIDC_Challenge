# CIDC_Challenge

This repository contains the project developed for the CIDC Challenge, in the year 2020. The project consisted of building a report and graphical interface to show the information, based on a spreadsheet available.

Basically, there are 3 main scripts:

- cidcchallenge: to separate the relevant information from the worksheet. It is worth mentioning that there are outliers that must be disregarded, so that the information shown leads to a correct conclusion. The entire process of removing these outliers takes place in the execution of this script

- gui: to display information in a graphical interface, including graphics and text

- report: to generate a summary report in the form of a word file.
